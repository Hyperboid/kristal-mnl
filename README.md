# Wonder Seed

A library that turns your beloved Deltarune engine into Mario & Luigi.

<!-- TODO: Write more stuff I guess -->

# Contributing Guidelines

1. Don't use assets you don't have permission for 
    - Don't use official Nintendo assets (unless you can *somehow* get a license, which I doubt)
2. Stay in the scope of recreating Mario & Luigi gameplay.
3. Kristal is still a Deltarune engine at it's core. Don't remove Deltarune.
4. If you work on one of the TODOs, there's a small possibility you might get your PR rejected just because I didn't see it in time. I really hope that never happens, but it might.
